        <t id="1030218">The Priest Xaar ordained this sector in clear understanding that the nearby nova was seen by many to be a gateway to higher dimensions. Deemed secure enough for a strong agricultural and mining operation, it also proved to be a gateway to the Split expansion, and a means by which to curtail further Boron growth.</t>

        <t id="1030303">Buried amongst the desolate streams of rock that cover this remote mining operation, lie the dreams of many who came here in search of fortune. Both equally crushed, both little more than a cold dark shadow of the lives they had once hoped for.</t>
        <t id="1030304">In Pluto lie the beginnings of the Kuiper Belt. Once thought of as being one of Sol's home planets, it has long since been orphaned and discarded to the uneasy drift of Kuiper's reign. Central Control for both Kuiper and Oort mining are based here, alongside the Military Base of Operations for the outer zones.</t>
        <t id="1030305">Known by many as Sol's Eye, Neptune's stunning blue shimmer has enticed many to travel further in search of such sights. The cold harsh winds here are sometimes farmed as a viable source of hydrogen.</t>
        <t id="1030306">Without feature or feeling, Uranus stands torn between the grip of the inner system and the hopes of those who have made this silent behemoth their home.</t>
        <t id="1030307">Massive by even Terran standards, Jupiter's magnificence is rarely lost on those who enter this sector. The planet's upper atmosphere hosts a wide array of semi-organic life, much of which is still under analysis.</t>
        <t id="1030308">To fly across the rings of Saturn, to know its beauty and splendour, to gaze upon such timeless grace, to do all these things is to finally accept your home amongst the stars. It remains a rite of passage for those wishing to gain true understanding of the journey taken.</t>
        <t id="1030312">Low ranking Paranid priests established this sector several years ago with dreams of establishing a foothold for a new branch of the church.  Financial woes and political errors resulted in the project falling short of its intended goal.  Slowly, private industry seeps into this sector to make the most of what their unlucky predecessors started.</t>
        <t id="1030313">Spring of Belief was originally a Boron sector named &quot;Queen's Paradise&quot;. An accident during a scientific experiment on the planet's surface released vast amounts of radiation. Soon after, the local population started to die of a mysterious disease. When it was discovered that the radiation was the cause, the Boron Government ordered an evacuation of the sector. Xenon fleets also tried to inhabit the sector, but the radiation affected electronic systems onboard their craft. As the radiation grew weaker the Paranid finally settled in this system and claimed it as their own. With the radiation now a minor problem the Boron Government has tried to reclaim the system, but the Paranid Government refuses to give up their tenure.</t>
        <t id="1030314">This sector, when discovered by the Paranid, was awash with Kha'ak. Paranid forces had daily skirmishes with them until one day, the Kha'ak completely disappeared from the sector, never to be seen there again.</t>
        <t id="1030315">Harmony</t>
        <t id="1030317">The Grand Exchange refers to the large skyscraper on the surface of Goldminer's Dream, the primary planet. The traders' exchange centre was supposed to control Teladi Company trade throughout the known universe. However repeated Kha'ak attacks on Teladi communications satellites halted the necessary communications.</t>
        <t id="1030318">The Teladi marked this sector as a hub for all commerce involving mining and food production. Choosing not to invest too far too soon, further sector discoveries were sold to the Boron, gaining further profit from the trade lane created. Tears of Greed was born upon the countless Teladi who had invested heavily on further sector development, their only choice to return to their homeworlds broken and bankrupt.</t>
        <t id="1030319">Despite the impression of respectability afforded to this system through the honoured name of Elena Kho, this asteroid-strewn colony is a favourite haunt of cut-throats, smugglers, wrecksweepers and hullcutters. The system has come to be a reliable, if illegal, source of controlled and specialized weaponry.</t>

        <t id="1030401">Starkiller's Hideout</t>
        <t id="1030402">This system provides the Split with a wide variety of food and raw materials as well as being the production centre for their heavy ship's Pulse Beam Lasers. Far from the 'wild space' this system is relatively safe from pirate attack although occasional skirmishes are reported.</t>
        <t id="1030403">This is the home to the once great Ryk Family. After a territorial dispute with the Njy family, Ryk lost one of their two outposts. The second colony is this system, which was taken from the ownership of the last Patriarch who fell in a great battle with Family Rhonkar. Unlike some other systems in the local area, this system is relatively uninteresting, but one may find the odd skirmish between the neighbouring Boron colony and the Ryk Family.</t>
        <t id="1030404">Deemed to be a viable Class IV mining operation by long-range scout vessels en-route to Proxima Centauri, the Oort Cloud remains largely untouched. Halfway between home and distant suns, few willingly choose to settle here. Those who do are often known to succumb to Oort's Curse, a madness with no reason or cure.</t>
        <t id="1030405">In past times, Earth's moon was little more than a glimmer of the dreams held within those who gazed upon it. The cratered surface now glittering with countless refineries and bases, few will ever remember it as being anything more than a stepping-stone to the stars.</t>
        <t id="1030406">The jewel of Sol system and home to mankind, Earth. While many see similarities to the Argon homeworld, Earth holds grace and beauty that few could deny as being anything other than unique. For this and painful historical reasons, the AGI Task Force zealously guards the planet and the imposing orbital ring station, the Torus.</t>
        <t id="1030407">Due to draconian security measures placed on Earth access, the USC chose to place their main base of operations in this sector. Those who reside here consider it fitting that the planet, named after the mythical god of war, has become home to the USC.</t>
        <t id="1030408">This agricultural system is run by the brutally efficient Njy family. It produces many Split foodstuffs that are shipped to the two planets in this system and neighbouring systems. The Njy family is particularly brutal, offensive and arrogant, even by Split standards.</t>
        <t id="1030409">This system used to belong to the Split Family Ryk, but after a dispute with the Family Njy, was taken in a rather strange battle. Njy outfitted some of their freighters with large explosives and changed their transmitter signal to say they were from Family Whi, they later sent a distress signal saying they were under attack by pirates. The Ryk Family Carrier came in to assist the freighters that were near the west gate, but when it was in range each of the six freighters simultaneously exploded, heavily damaging the carrier. Njy then moved in their destroyers and attacked the Ryk's military forces, destroying the carrier with relative ease, and seizing the system in the name of the family Njy.</t>
        <t id="1030412">The Ore and Silicon mines in this system provide mineral resources to the entire Paranid Empire. These energy hungry mines operate continuously, their workers dedicating their labour to the glory of the Xaar. The Paranid Empire permits limited mining on the untapped asteroids in this sector but only Paranid may enter the sacred mines on the 'rusty planet' XylaXaar.</t>
        <t id="1030413">The jewel of the Paranid Empire produces some of the finest ship equipment available - devastating thermo-nuclear missiles, semi-organic ship hulls, artificially intelligent flight systems and highly powerful lasers are among the tech products to be found. The skies of Paranid Prime are dominated by a fiery gas cloud, the aftermath of a terrible Xenon experiment.</t>
        <t id="1030414">Although this system is primarily concerned with agricultural production, the factories in this system make it a prime target for raiding or sabotage. The stormy ringed planet that dominates this system is currently being terraformed by the Paranid for inhabitation in the near future.</t>
        <t id="1030415">Goner prophets and mystics, their mission now complete, travel along a very different path to that of their forefathers. The burning prophecy that Nathan R Gunne's words once held is embodied in this sector, now home to an ever-increasing number of believers, intent on ensuring that the truth of Gunne's Crusade lives on in eternity. To that end, each new station is blessed and considered a distant annexe of the Goner Temple.</t>
        <t id="1030416">Sector is not recognized in the database.</t>
        <t id="1030417">Merchant Haven was established to be a major trade port for the new Teladi expansion campaign. However the plans failed when surprise attacks by hostile forces stopped the advance into nearby systems. The sector now serves the local Teladi population and trades with the nearby Argon and Split.</t>
        <t id="1030418">There is no data on this sector save that it contains a huge watery planet known by the Boron as 'Saa-Russ' or 'Life of the Sea' which legend insists is inhabited by giant sea dragons. Many ships have set out to explore this system, though very few have returned.</t>
        <t id="1030419">This system manufactures hardware for the refit yards in Emperor's Ridge. It also provides masses of mineral and organic products to be consumed by their crews. Despite a heavy security around the military installations the Space Jewellery workshop provides rich pickings for the more aggressive and desperate looters and pirates based in nearby systems.</t>

        <t id="1030503">Originally held by the Boron, there remains an uneasy truce here. Several high-ranking members of Family Rhonkar, accused of unauthorised attempts to purge the sector of all Boron occupation, were placed on trial and summarily executed for genocide. While time has eased the pain of those who remember, forgiveness is far from forthcoming.</t>
        <t id="1030504">Family Dispute</t>
        <t id="1030505">Scorched by the fires of eternity, Mercury remains a modern-day Gehenna for those who still believe in such a place. Forsaken by all but the most hardy of voyagers, there are few systems that hold greater torment.</t>
        <t id="1030506">The bitter crushing winds that envelop Venus are matched only by the tenacity of those who have chosen to colonise this sector. The settlers of Venus take pride in atmospheric farming, their yield being equally acidic as their wit.</t>
        <t id="1030507">Miners within this sector are constantly aware that their work is undertaken under the strict scrutiny of security forces, allocated to protect the jump gate recently relocated from Earth. The military presence here is sometimes overwhelming, and often intimidating.</t>
        <t id="1030508">This deep space system is about as close as the Split get to a civilian operation. It produces food and other organic products and mines the asteroids that are spread throughout the system. Although there is little military presence here all Split are required to complete combat training and civilian Split pilots are no easy target.</t>
        <t id="1030509">One of the Split's more remote Core sectors with a moderate output of agricultural products. Military operations here serve as a base for the building conflict in nearby sectors. Tension with the Boron is already high and set to escalate.</t>
        <t id="1030510">Holding the Strong Arms HQ, Thyn's Excavation provides funds and resources for the ongoing conflict in Veil of Delusion. Naturally this has extended to arms shipments wherever else they are needed. For the Split, the price of war is never too high.</t>
        <t id="1030511">This sector has only recently become part of the Paranid Empire. It hosts Paranid citizens who feel that a life of exclusion and exile are the only true way to enlightenment. The Paranid in this sector have little time for lesser beings and even less inclination to have any dealings with them. This is reflected by the distinct lack of trading opportunities in the sector.</t>
        <t id="1030512">This sector has recently been populated by hard-line Paranid religious fanatics who chose to leave Unholy Descent after what they considered to be the sector's decline into unholiness. There is a tense and xenophobic atmosphere in the sector and very little communication exists with its neighbour.</t>
        <t id="1030513">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonists of not following the Paranid religion.</t>
        <t id="1030514">On the border between Teladi and Boron space, this system acts as a major commercial centre for trade between the Foundation and Profit Guilds, as well as providing large amounts of raw mineral resources. Although the Split rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Teladi. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the greater profit of the Teladi of course.</t>
        <t id="1030515">Once the favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector is now managed by the Teladi and has become the preferred destination of fun seekers, weedheads and space-hippies of every race. The Bliss Place in the centre of the sector produces the narcotic spaceweed, the meditative drug of choice for the dreamers, artists and neo-philosophers that are drawn here.</t>

        <t id="1030519">This system contains the main Equipment Dock used to refit medium Paranid Fighters. These weapons are of the highest quality and Paranid technology is extremely reliable. This system was hit heavily in the last Xenon conflict and security is still tight. This system represents the far border of the 'Old Paranid Empire', the 'New Empire' consisting of territories claimed since the conflict.</t>

Executor squads routinely patrol, laying in wait for pilots escorted into the sector to face their final moments before being taken by the void. The outer rim is littered with the corpses and wreckage of the damned and the wretched.</t>
        <t id="1030603">Originally deemed to be impossible to settle due to deeply drifting nebulae, The Shallows remained largely unpopulated. With recent solar flares having helped to clear the nebulae, building has continued at greater depths. Both Split and Boron forces currently contest this area, both eager to regain lost ground.</t>
        <t id="1030604">Slave traders had once used this pocket of space as a rendezvous outpost for trade operations.  As the result of two unknown split families war actions, however, these operations were considered too much of a liability to continue.  Eventually private industry took over, and the sector's trade community flourishes to this day.</t>
        <t id="1030605">Icarus</t>
        <t id="1030606">Originally discovered and claimed by the Paranid, Heretic's End was used primarily as a remote training area. Since the activation of the gate to Earth in this sector and the massive battle that ensued between the Kha'ak and a combined Terran and Commonwealth force, Terran forces have annexed this sector with little argument from the Paranid. The sector has become a buffer zone between Terran and non-Terran space, patrolled by a large contingent of Terran ships.</t>
        <t id="1030607">Originally discovered and declared lifeless by the earth science vessel 'Winterblossom', under the command of Rene Farnham, this system is now a lawless community of high-tech criminals. The illegal computer and weapons systems covertly built here are renowned for innovation if not reliability. None of which you will find publicly available. The hackers and cyberpunks who operate here are notoriously paranoid and are heavily guarded by armed enforcers.</t>
        <t id="1030608">Deep in unclaimed space this system is little more than a long established and well respected ambush. Rogue Teladi and Argon stations provide cover for aggressive Pirate strike forces. A single, cratered moon holds the wrecks of many of the ships disabled, stripped and left to fall to its surface by freebooters, hullcutters and privateers.</t>
        <t id="1030609">Weapons are required by many of the hidden outposts and illicit operations in unclaimed space. This system provides some of the necessary supplies and is protected by both a covert Pirate presence and a thick asteroid field. The mineral content of these asteroids is likely to cause a conflict between the smugglers and the legitimate mining corporations sooner or later.</t>
        <t id="1030610">The Split have chosen to maintain this sector as little more than a trench upon which to launch further attacks against the Boron in nearby sectors. Boron incursions are routine, as they struggle to regain control. There is little here that does not involve war or conquest.</t>
        <t id="1030611">This system was once a Split mining outpost. One Tazura a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by Argon Federation security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a shattered, radioactive hell. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon super-weapon is to blame and access to the system is now restricted. Pilots who passed though this system once said that there was a large ship in this system, but recently these reports have stopped. If this ship existed, then it is unknown where it has gone now.</t>

        <t id="1030614">The factory and refinery workers of Profit Share are renowned for working hard - and partying even harder. The Bliss place can be rough at a cycle's end - on refinery pay-day when the dice are loaded and the stakes are high, tempers can get frayed. The smokeshacks and speakeasies of Profit Share are commonly frequented by the more colourful Pirate crews.</t>
        <t id="1030615">With a wealth of untapped mineral resources and busy commercial and industrial installations, trade in the Teladi's home system is potentially very lucrative. Although well policed, the wealth of this system attracts opportunistic Pirate activity. To guard the profit of the many, a Teladi Destroyer often stands guard over this sector.</t>
        <t id="1030617">Unholy Gift</t>
        <t id="1030618">The Priest Duke brought this sector into being with only one thought. Overwhelming firepower. Heavily militarised, with both Shipyard and Equipment Dock facilities, it is both Citadel and Fortress. Your presence here will not go unnoticed.</t>
        <t id="1030619">Despite fanciful miners' tales that the asteroids in this system are all made of solid Nividium they seem to be rich in only the more mundane ore and silicon. The two factories producing cheap, commercial jewellery for the export market are well defended against opportunistic attack but attract the occasional raids from determined freeloaders.</t>

        <t id="1030703">With the discovery of the North Gate in the neighbouring 'Shore of Infinity' sector, Light Water was founded. With a mixture of food production and solar power generators, this system has grown in importance. The name Light Water was given to this sector as the only habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size, its surface being mostly covered in water. The Boron have recently founded a planet-based colony using materials that were destined for the LooManckStrat's Legacy system before plans were scrapped.</t>
        <t id="1030704">The planet 'Oceania' is a huge world enveloped in swirling coloured mists and encircled with spectacular dust rings. It is a popular meditative resort for Boron monks who spend weeks in isolation in the planet's aquatic wilderness to contemplate the purpose and meaning of life. The installations here service these pilgrims' basic needs.</t>
        <t id="1030705">This new Boron colony is being constructed with the aid of the Argon. After heavy losses in the Split and Xenon conflicts the Boron are eager not to confine themselves to one cluster of systems as they have in the past. The foundations of a thriving mining colony have already been completed and stage two is well underway.</t>
        <t id="1030706">This busy Boron mining colony doubles as a refit and supply centre for Boron ships working the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids make the Boron who dwell here harder and more cynical than their compatriots nearer the Boron home systems.</t>
        <t id="1030707">This system is sparsely populated, dedicated purely to the production of raw materials and food for installations in the surrounding systems. The presence of weapons production facilities requires heavy protection by Federation ships against sabotage attacks from Pirates seeking to weaken Argon defences.</t>
        <t id="1030708">The Argon mine workers in this mineral rich system are famed across space for their ability to consume vast quantities of Space Fuel. Their semi-legal bootlegging operation keeps the miners happy and the bosses rich. Strong liquor loosens tongues and the system is a hive of gossip, rumour and dubious scuttlebuzz.</t>
        <t id="1030709">This Argon system's economy is heavily reliant on trade between the Argon and their Boron allies. The Foundation Guild has its Headquarters here and the Trading Station is the temporary seat of the newly founded Boron Chamber of Commerce. The many cattle ranches here supply Argnu Beef for the local and export markets.</t>
        <t id="1030710">Much of the illicit trading in the known universe goes on in this system. Pirates and smugglers trade with all races and act as go-betweens for sensitive or illegal deals between species. There is a thriving industry in the cheap, counterfeit Paranid jewellery that is often used as conveniently anonymous payment in black market deals.</t>
        <t id="1030711">It was a surprise to the entire commonwealth when the Phanon Corporation CEO Zalex Yhulan announced on the GNN that their subsidiary companies would be stationed in this newly discovered sliver of the galaxy.  With little resources or population to speak of, rumours say that the Phanon prefer it this way; a place away from prying eyes and pointed questions.</t>
        <t id="1030712">After the battle in the sector known today as Nopileos' Memorial, the Xenon have used this sector as a junkyard, storing and recycling ships here. The coordinates for the gate to this sector were lost, but a recent survey by Argon Expeditionary forces have since rediscovered the gate's location.</t>

        <t id="1030714">This system is jealously guarded by the Teladi as it contains scarce organic and mineral resources. The seas of Phobass IV produce kilometre high waves - the best surfing in the universe bar none! The system has a thriving tourist trade based mainly on Boron day-trips to the Planet's many underwater resorts.</t>
        <t id="1030715">A relatively safe system, ideal for short trading runs and a debut in factory ownership. The Sun Oil Refineries in this system and more in the surrounding systems are reliant on imported sunrise flowers - making this an ideal location for a Solar Power Plant and Dream Farm.</t>
        <t id="1030718">On the border of Argon and Boron space the populated planets of this system are a popular vacation destination for Argon high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings. The very best in Argon cuisine is made in this system. The Equipment Dock provides a wide choice of weapons and upgrades for combat ships and pleasure-cruisers alike.</t>
        <t id="1030719">Sometime before the last Xenon conflict the planet 'Shipfall' was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Argon industrial colony. Some effort has been made to re-establish the colony since, but its activities are currently restricted mainly to mining and agriculture.</t>
        <t id="1030720">This sector was once occupied by the Argon Federation's largest station, the Antigone. It was attacked in 215 by the largest Xenon fleet known to date. The station launched its defence fleet when one of the Xenon ships fired into the docking bays, destroying several fighter wings and setting off a chain reaction from damaged propulsion systems in the process. The station was destroyed, killing thousands of people. Some crew and visitors managed to make it out through emergency escape pods that were recovered once the Xenon had retreated. In one of the largest recovery efforts ever made by the Argon, medevac ships were dispatched to assist. One of these, the Springbird, was attacked while leaving the sector, forcing it into the atmosphere of the planet 'Sandwell'. All contact was subsequently lost. The recovery operation was extended to find survivors on the planet surface, none were ever located, perhaps due to the scorching heat from the local star. The outpost has now become a place of remembrance for the many Argon who travel here to honour their war dead.</t>
        <t id="1030803">Of little use to the Paranid, this system is leased by the Boron who have a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants here. Limited trade between the Paranid and Boron takes place here and relations between the species are amicable. In return for Paranid protection the Boron lend their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranid efforts in cyber biology.</t>
        <t id="1030804">This small Boron outpost produces mineral products as well as the highly regarded Stotts Spices. It has attracted little hostile attention so far. The Boron tolerate the Split using this system as a convenient route to unexplored space in return for safe passage of Boron craft through certain Split systems.</t>
        <t id="1030805">Located next to Split space this system is usually on a knife edge of tension. The Boron have no military presence here lest they give the Split an excuse to attack and instead rely on the covert intelligence and good will of other species to dissuade the Split from aggression.</t>
        <t id="1030806">This system was the centre of the Xenon weapons test zone during the last conflict. The system's planet was blown apart by an experimental weapon, probably the rumored 'Galaxy Killer' device - used to vaporise and ignite the still burning 'Hadesfire Nebulae'. It is now a laid-back Boron mining and farming colony.</t>
        <t id="1030807">This outpost of basic installations acts as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area. It produces only the basic products most required by small ships and installations. The system is the spiritual home of the popular Argon sport known as 'Hardball'.</t>
        <t id="1030808">Bathed in the sacred light of the sun 'Sonra', the Argon home system is dominated by the planet 'Argon Prime'. This rich and beautiful world is densely populated and is usually protected by a large Argon Military force, a Titan Destroyer and more recently the Argon's latest flagship carrier, the Argon One, a Colossus class Carrier. Most of the needs of the Argon space fleet are catered for here in orbiting shipyards that also outfit private fighters and transport ships with Argon technology.</t>
        <t id="1030809">This system provides much needed power and food to the Argon Military as well as providing a convenient temporary HQ for the rapid response squads set up against Pirate activity and Xenon insurgence. It is often used as a base to recharge long range recon ships and carriers and as a result is a well defended and often dangerous system during times of conflict.</t>
        <t id="1030810">This lawless system is the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants have made a fortune trading illicit goods. Many, many more have been ripped-off, ambushed, swindled, bushwhacked, conned, assaulted, hijacked, stranded, killed or worse.</t>
        <t id="1030811">Bathed in the scorched glow of a burning nebula, this system was levelled by the devastating experimental weaponry used by Xenon forces in the last great conflict. Once a busy cosmopolitan trading outpost, it is now a rough and ready mining community run by smuggler overlords, possibly in the pay of the powerful Paranid Jewellery cartels.</t>
        <t id="1030812">After the Xenon conflict this system was abandoned. When the retreating Xenon completely destroyed a neighbouring system by forcing its twin suns to go nova, the colonies and factories of this system were eradicated. It is the home to many refugees of the last Xenon war and the other minor wars that came before it. The people here begin to build new lives and homes while they mourn their past and hope for their future.</t>

Its proximity to the lawless pirate sectors does however make security in this sector an issue. Race events held here do make for some of the most interesting races in the league calendar.</t>
        <t id="1030818">The Argon military have taken full advantage of the rich resources in this area. Competition is fierce with many companies all competing for business. There are still profit opportunities, however, in mining for the export market. The station here acts as a resupply point for Argon Military fighters and a good selection of surplus weapon systems can be found there.</t>
        <t id="1030819">Scattered in the shadow of the now terraformed planet 'Kho's Haven', this recently re-colonised system's installations are mainly concerned with the production of high quality electronics and fabrics. Lax security arrangements make this system a favourite route for Pirate raiding parties looking for richer pickings.</t>
        <t id="1030820">Now little more than a smouldering shell, Presidents End stands testament to the ferocity of the Kha'ak. What little remains here has been left untouched, a silent memorial and burial ground to the countless souls who lost their lives, unable to escape this sector's final demise. With gates that link to areas that hold even greater anarchy, Argon security patrols struggle to maintain any semblance of control over the sector. Plans to rebuild are still held back by the fear of further reprisals. Perhaps in time Presidents End will see a new beginning, but until then this sector remains in mourning.</t>
        <t id="1030821">This little-known sector has been occupied by the Paranid Pirate Duke and his army, known for their coldness and cruelty. Only a very few ships are allowed to enter the sector, and only a few of those dare to do business with the Duke.</t>
        <t id="1030903">Recently discovered, the Boron have heralded this peaceful slice of space as the new destination getaway for the upper class.  This of course didn't stop private investment firms from capitalizing on the rich resources this sector has to offer.</t>

        <t id="1030906">The original name for this sector was Light of Hope, until the Xenon attacked many jazuras ago. It was clear that the sector's patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using small transport ships. Backup from the Argon Military was sent; four Titan class destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with fighter wings. They were to escort the transport ships out of the system, but before they could get to the gate, Xenon ships jumped in and overwhelmed the destroyers and carriers. All civilian ships and one destroyer, the Challenger, escaped. Three jazuras later, an Argon force, with Boron assistance, took back Light of Hope and it was renamed Wastelands, reflecting the carnage and debris that the force found.  Now cleared of that detritus and with the Xenon threat now greatly diminished, its inhabitants strive to maintain a normal existence.</t>
        <t id="1030907">Midnight Star was discovered by Argon Expeditionary Forces and named because of the angle at which the now colonised planet faces the sun, leaving one hemisphere in eternal darkness.</t>
        <t id="1030908">This sector was established shortly after the initial Kha'ak invasions, and was intended as a support sector for supplying food and minerals to other Argon colonies.</t>
        <t id="1030909">Named after the Argon heroine and Goner priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. It is now a rough place where times are hard and people harder. There is much illegal activity in this system and skirmishes are common.</t>
        <t id="1030910">The last Xenon conflict with the sentient races brought forth many heroes. This system is named after one of the foremost of those who risked all to repel the Xenon threat. Although the name still has deep echoes of honour, courage and wisdom, the system is corrupt and dangerous. The Argon are particularly concerned that the use of this system as a base for the slave trade is an insult to one of their most honoured names.</t>
        <t id="1030911">The leader of the Split family Rhy discovered and occupied this sector shortly after the Kha'ak invasions began. The sector was supposedly taken from the Kha'ak by the Rhy Family in an unconfirmed story.</t>
        <t id="1030912">This sector contains one half of Family Rhy's assets. They use this system as a supply depot to passing split craft. The planet's main colony consists of a large geodesic dome. Inside one can find large amounts of weaponry being sold in armoury markets. Pirate activity in this system is also increased because of the local activity, but the Rhy Family does nothing to stop this. Being on the border of the local Teladi Sectors, Rhy's Desire can usually find large numbers of Teladi coming in to trade and purchase these illegal goods.</t>
        <t id="1030913">The home system of the Split, Family Pride is a major resupply point for the Split military as well as having a bustling civilian commercial district. Its primary planet houses the HQ of the Council of All Families - the martial government that rules over Split affairs.</t>

A strange religious sect reside here in a huge orbiting temple, searching for the secrets of sentient life in the Universe by studying ancient legends and deep historical analysis.</t>
        <t id="1030919">This mining outpost is surrounded by a field of mineral bearing asteroids with a particularly dense asteroid field to the north. Pirate activity is light and generally non-aggressive, mostly transports headed for the north gate. This is fortunate as high-speed combat in this system is made difficult by the asteroids which also play havoc with missile targeting scanners.</t>
        <t id="1030920">This quiet and unassuming system is a resupply point for the Argon military. Hostile activity is generally minimal as it is well guarded by security patrols. The space equipment dock is a useful source of surplus military equipment as well as second hand kit used by the many Argon Military training outposts in the area.</t>

The entire system was only accessible via one lone gate when first discovered. Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food supplies to rest of the Argon Federation, Interworlds has expanded to include more high tech stations and products. It is also home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, which is still looking for any new gate routes that can be used.</t>

Equipment, raw materials, ship upgrades and installations of many types can be traded here in a relatively secure environment. This is the Boron home world and a place of quiet contemplation and study.</t>
        <t id="1031010">The existence of this sector was thought to be little more than a legend. That was until a lone Boron pilot, crazed with fear and exhaustion, was picked up in the Menelaus Paradise sector. He died shortly after rescue, babbling desperately about an eternal cosmic horror buried deep in the skin of a 'dark planet'. Since then Argon spy probes have been sent in to investigate; as of yet, no discovery has been made public.</t>
        <t id="1031011">Patriarch's Victory</t>
        <t id="1031012">The lesser family of Rhy, in the days before space colonisation, spent most of their time on Split Prime, using their knowledge of espionage and sabotage to plunder other families resources and claim them as salvage. Rhy moved off-world to their own system when they became a more powerful family, after helping the family Rhonkar in their battle against the old Patriarch. This sector contains half of the family's assets in space trading, including their own carrier. Rhy no longer focuses solely on espionage and have started to build up their own military. There are also rumours in local bars of a hidden gate in or near to this system.</t>

        <t id="1031107">This sector holds a major settlement recently set up by the Boron, a construction colony based on ship production. The system is named for the nebula that is located nearby. The colony itself has facilities for both families and the military, with municipal recreation domes containing restaurants, water-parks and marinas.</t>
        <t id="1031108">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system is a source of strategic power for the Boron. Being a border colony to the local Split Family, this sector also acts as a crossroads for other Boron settlements, making it particularly important for passing trade. It is guarded by a lone destroyer with escorts, thus pirate activity here is minimal.</t>
        <t id="1031109">The Boron produce high quality electronics and semi-organic computer systems as well as more conventional goods in this large and crowded sector. The supporting factories produce a wealth of raw materials for the local and export markets.</t>
        <t id="1031110">Although many ships have been sent to survey this sector, few have returned. Once shunned by all the sentient species, last surveillance records show the system was home to a pirate base that the Xenon constantly placed under attack. Pirate forces set this base up in search of easy pickings when the Xenon fleet jumped to the neighbouring grid 596, only to find the Xenon returned a few wozuras later. With access to the gate blocked, evacuation attempts were futile, leaving them with no option except to hold their position. Their survival in this sector is still a case for much debate.</t>

        <t id="1031117">This sector is considered to be one of high importance. In ancient times the Emperor's palace in the high mountains of the Paranid Homeworld became so cold the ice would keep away any travellers. The Emperor chose on such occasions to stay at his winter palace in the equatorial region. When the Xenon nearly destroyed Paranid Prime's atmosphere, the equatorial region was all but lost. Until recently the Emperor stayed at his palace in the mountains, accessible because of the heat from the Xenon experiment. In order to keep with tradition he set up a new winter palace in this sector, overlooking a great lake at the foot on the Kar Miat Mountains. In the winter of Paranid Prime's northern hemisphere, the Emperor usually occupies this sector with his advisory Dukes, keeping the long tradition that was lost for so long.</t>
        <t id="1031118">The last great Duke came to this sector and after a few short stazuras being in the system he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known to be the Kha'ak. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Paranid Prime in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow.</t>
        <t id="1031119">Long-range scout patrols from Cardinal's Domain ventured upon this sector at the same time as the arrival of a mining expedition from Aladna Hill. The resulting tensions did little but re-open old wounds. Few Paranid would deny the opportunity to fan the flames of a war brought over from the old world.</t>
        <t id="1031120">Originally discovered and claimed by the Split Patriarch as a hideaway, this sector is now a thriving commercial colony. It is from here that the Split Patriarch ordered his forces to repel the attacks from the rebelling Family Rhonkar. In the final tazuras of the war, this sector was made impenetrable with three of the Patriarch's latest prototype destroyers. They managed to defend the sector with their armament of 20 plasma throwers per ship. The Rhonkar family eventually found a way around this blockade. They sent in a small fleet of heavy fighters that made a successful kamikaze run against the command vessel and destroyed it. Then a combined Rhonkar - Njy fleet attacked, eliminating the other two prototypes. The Patriarch was captured and deposed. The plans of these prototypes were lost in battle.</t>
        <t id="1031202">In striking out against the growing conflict with the Split, Menelaus established this sector to be the first in the new colonies. A Core sector, specialising in technological and military output, hell hath no fury greater than a Queen's retribution.</t>
        <t id="1031203">The Boron have established this sector to take advantage of the resources needed for growth of military and technological industry and nearby sectors. Agricultural and mineral output is both secure and of considerable volume.</t>

        <t id="1031218">The name is deceiving, but there is a meaning. The sector is located close to the Ma'kare star; the dominating feature is the flare that streams though the system. Because the stations are located so close to the star, all stations were fitted with a new reflective Teladianium armour that allow for the flares to hit the station and only affect it slightly. Although the shields do protect the stations by absorbing 80 percent of the energy, the rest is reflected back by the armour. The name comes from the high priest, who visited this sector shortly after discovery. Back then the flare was still at a distance, and the moving star was also at a distance, so the sector was a void. Many religious Paranid thought that the star that was drawing closer was an omen and so many preachers came to see this, hence the name.</t>
        <t id="1031219">Caught between the expansion of both races, the Paranid hold this sector while facing continual incursions from the Argon. It serves as a place of rest for those known as The Fallen, priests who have lost their way amongst the stars. Redemption comes to all, in time.</t>
        <t id="1031220">The Split secured this mineral rich system from the Xenon rearguard early after the last Xenon conflict but sustained heavy losses doing so. It now exists as a welcome, if rough, trading post on a busy route between many species' systems. Few communities hate the Xenon more than the inhabitants of this system.</t>

        <t id="1031301">The Boron colonised this sector with dreams of such magnificence even the Queen offered her blessings. Flourishing for a great while, such dreams indeed became reality until the Split discovered and gained control over the connecting sector. Trade turned to war and dreams once cherished were left faded and broken.</t>
        <t id="1031302">Specialising in food and power storage technology, Queen's Harbour offers a wide array of wares. It is used as a re-supply point for many major passenger transports, and on occasion, the Queen's own personal carrier.</t>
        <t id="1031303">Once a haven for the Queen herself, Menelaus no longer retreats here in times of trouble. Conflict in nearby sectors has borne a wealth of agriculture, high-tech goods and military hardware needed to supply the war front.</t>

        <t id="1031305">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through this system. Subsequently many jazuras of archaeology and recovery was undertaken with the assistance of the Argon. After the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in, but the jump into the system did not go as planned. On entry, they found themselves in the middle of a pirate ambush. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed. The pirates have since planted a large minefield in the hope of capturing other ships; travel through this system should be taken with great care.</t>
        <t id="1031306">A high Teladi court official used this sector as an unprecedented arbitration strategy in the mediation between two squabbling medium sized companies.  The premise was a financial strategy battle of wits, and whomever managed to profit most would have emerged the litigation victor.  As both companies managed to surpass all initial expectations of the obscure arbitration, the legal battle was quickly forgotten and healthy trade between both companies is at an all-time high.</t>
        <t id="1031307">Situated between two uninhabitable dust planets this relatively new Teladi system produces raw materials as well as light weapons for military and exploration ships. This system is earmarked by the Profit Guild for priority expansion and investment.</t>
        <t id="1031308">This system is home to the organisation that controls the supply of the rare mineral Nividium. Its factories produce high-quality weapons for the Teladi as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by the PTNI's security arm as well as Teladi Company ships.</t>
        <t id="1031309">Increased Kha'ak activity has meant that the Paranid have made no move to reclaim this inhospitable sector and no other race has shown interest as it borders only Paranid space. Localised Yaki activity is also a negative point to consider, leading some to believe it is used as a Pirate or Yaki safe-haven.</t>

        <t id="1031311">After a failed attempt at securing land from the Njy family, the Zyarth family had no choice but to look elsewhere. Rumours emerged over time that the Ryk family had discovered a new system which they were soon planning to occupy. However, because of a lack of resources, they kept such knowledge a closely guarded secret - or so they thought. Acting upon data collected from their spies, the Zyarth family moved in quickly and established a colony, much to the Ryk family's anger.</t>
        <t id="1031312">Bordering a dangerous Xenon system, this sector satisfied the glory-seeking Split for many years until the minor skirmishes turned into a fight for survival. Recently, a major Xenon fleet entered the sector, the west gate mysteriously shut-down, cutting off both the supply lines and escape route.  It took months to regain a foothold in the sector, with the tenacious Split rebuilding with surprising renewal.</t>
        <t id="1031313">With the Xenon approaching, the Split found themselves falling back into this desolate system. Supplies were only delivered by jumpdrive or freighter by ship captains mad enough to brave the Xenon forces.  However, that was a while ago, and Split have short memories.  In conjunction with their neighbours, the colonists have been re-establishing this sector as their home, with little heed as to the possibility of history repeating itself.</t>
        <t id="1031314">Not much is known about this empty portion of space, except that the presence of an ominous Xenon gate gives a solid explanation of why it remains unclaimed.</t>

        <t id="1031318">Perhaps the stunning gas nebulae that dominate the view in this system and the general atmosphere of peace and tranquillity are what inspire the gorgeous jewellery crafted by the Paranid here. The tiny masterpieces they craft from Majaglit can take years to complete and are collected avariciously by art enthusiasts from around the systems.</t>
        <t id="1031319">Perdition's flames brought fear to the hearts of both Argon and Paranid, and fury and rage from both sides have quenched the firestorm that burned through this sector. Perdition's end may soon be near, but the fires of conquest still burn brightly.</t>
        <t id="1031320">Situated in a heavy asteroid belt this forbidding Split mining colony has grown into the second capital system of Split space. It is a successful trading location as well as providing much needed support for Split military ships. Run by the relatively liberal Thi Family this is the only Split system not using forced labour in its factories.</t>
        <t id="1031321">On the Split-Teladi border, this sector is the focal point for much of the limited trade between the Split and other species. The two Teladi systems between Family Whi and the nearest Boron system provide a buffer between the two feuding species. It is usual, however, to find Split on guard against the unlikely threat of a Boron sneak attack.</t>
        <t id="1031322">Whi's Dragon</t>
        <t id="1031401">This sector began life in relative peace, both sides sharing resources equally. Open conflict between the Split and Boron soon changed that. Now a mire of lawlessness, the Boron no longer have the resources needed to simultaneously engage both Pirate and Split forces.</t>
        <t id="1031402">{19,1}\n\nThis Z sector was a venture fronted mostly by Argon security forces.</t>
        <t id="1031403">This sector, claimed only very recently, is the result of a Boron Royal Research Institute effort to scout for rare minerals in asteroid-rich sectors. Given its proximity to Boron territory and the absence of any objections from other interested parties, a major mineral survey was set in motion. Unfortunately the effort did not pay off and no particularly valuable minerals were found. It is now home to a small mining colony in the hopes that at least some of the costs can be recouped.</t>
        <t id="1031404">Forgotten Realm</t>
        <t id="1031405">This sector was worthless to other races, inaccessible by other races because of the minefield in the sector to the north. This sector was originally a boron research sector, and with a handful of stations this colony was a working one. When the colony plans for LooManckStrat's Legacy fell though after a pirate attack this colony had to be abandoned. Some stations were scuttled while others were later reactivated by pirate forces who have now laid claim to this system.</t>
        <t id="1031406">The Teladi claimed this system with the sole intention of colonising the two massive planets here. The awful fate of the first scouting parties to the planets' surfaces and the discovery of the hostile nature of the indigenous life forms dwelling there have ended such plans and the system is slowly decaying into a place of fear, lawlessness and anarchy.</t>

        <t id="1031411">This sector is home to the disgraced family T'kr, who were held responsible for a tragic incident that destroyed a Split shipyard and killed five hundred Split. What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was, the then Patriarch of All Split, using T'kr as a sign to all Split that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it has been only in recent jazuras that the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also marks the border for the Teladi 'fortune' system block. Three sectors that the Teladi use for production, and also contain the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system.</t>
        <t id="1031412">Once owned by the T'kr Family, this was a hub of activity. Mining was the main job here, but after the Dragon Incident this sector was seized by the neighbouring Njy family under orders from the Patriarch of all Split. Now the sector has run into disrepair, new stations have been built but are poorly maintained, pirate activity has increased and remnants of a minefield placed by T'kr to stop the seizure of the system can be found hidden in nebula streams. Pilots are asked to take caution in this system, as these mines could still be operational.</t>
        <t id="1031413">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further in this area of space this Split colony is heavily guarded and produces surveillance equipment and defensive weapons, allegedly for protection against Boron aggression.

        <t id="1031417">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war. Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. The jump gate used by the Xenon to retreat was left intact, allowing rapid exploration of the space beyond this system and the ruthless hunting of Xenon stragglers by rogue squads of revenge-seeking veterans.</t>
        <t id="1031418">The ageing but brilliant nuclear scientist, Akeela Hartnell, had one dream: to create a string of artificial suns that would light her way, and provide solar power for the ever expanding colonisation of sectors and planets by all races. The vessel that would allow Akeela to see her dream set off on its journey, but as it cleared the Omicron Lyrae system the ship was hit by an asteroid travelling so fast that it was virtually impossible to avoid, greatly damaging the ship. The crew, except for Akeela, disembarked and made their escape from the ship at best speed. Akeela succeeded in getting the ship away from the inhabited sectors, but the resulting explosion changed the sectors gate that locked onto the Aladna Hill sector. For a project that nearly ended in disaster, Akeela's Beacon is her gift to the people of the galaxy. A request by Akeela's last will and testament asked that the Argon govern the new system, but it should be a free place, and a safe haven for all traders. The four glowing stars that once graced this sector, - the result of Akeela's dream, are all but faded and gone. Yet her dream remains in the hearts of many, and so the sector is named after her.</t>

        <t id="1031505">This rogue sector is on the main trade lane between old sectors and more recent expansions of the Paranid Empire. A small trading post that runs itself independently from other races. It has little or no police, with pirate raiding parties taking the opportunity to seize power in this system. Most ships that come though this sector can be expected to come under some form of attack, and with the Paranid not willing to send in forces to assist ships with the exception of other Paranid traders, there is little chance of official help.</t>
        <t id="1031506">This system is typical of small scale Teladi trading outposts. It produces Teladi speciality goods as well as traditional foodstuffs both for local and export markets.

Argon and Paranid scouts returning from missions have reported ships known to be of Yaki origin, patrolling both this and the adjacent sector of Ocracoke's Storm.  Clearly both sectors offer a battlefront upon which to launch further attacks, while protecting the dark secrets thought to dwell deep within the Badlands.

        <t id="1031603">Despite a growing Teladi presence in this sector, and plans to take over control, pirate forces in this sector simply don't care. Perhaps mindful that the primary commerce here involves narcotics, the Teladi are happy to take advantage of the situation.</t>

        <t id="1031709">This Argon colony was founded by Kleo Gult, head of the Argon Agricultural Council, but as work continued, it was discovered that more uses could be found for the system. The sector is owned by the AAC which means very little money has been put aside for updating non-essential technology. Residents have thus needed to find a way to make money apart from selling wares and produce. It is believed that there are some illegal goods being sold in the sector, but this has yet to be proven as residents police and protect this sector themselves. Streams of nebula also inhabit this system, and Circle of Labour is usually home to several scientists who try to find a way to mine this untouched resource. The system is unusual as the sun bursts with strong phases of intense light.</t>
        <t id="1031710">Being the first and only Teladi Sector located next to a Paranid Sector, the Teladi opened this sector for massive amounts of trade, but trade with the Paranid was not a sensible decision. Turnover was low and few Paranid passed through sectors with only the odd ship coming in for supplies. The Teladi Chairman for this sector noticed they were slowly going into debt and so pulled out most of the high tech factories. The sector was then dubbed Bad Debt and the name has since stuck. Although relations between the two races are improving, trade is increasing at a minimal rate. Because of this debt the Teladi trade dock is relatively quiet, with cargo bays remaining empty and most market sections closed off and in a state of decay.</t>
        <t id="1031711">While the Teladi Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector may choose to disagree. The Vault is a system hard to reach by normal means; this sector contains nothing but high tech stations. The Vault is also home to the Teladi Company's main research facility, always trying to improve upon current technology. Whilst this sector is relatively new, it is thought that it will be expanded further with new ship design and construction facilities.

        <t id="1031715">This sector has long been known for its pirate activity, but is now openly claimed by a local pirate clan leader. That this is happening on the doorstep of a core Teladi sector has led to speculation that the Teladi CEO may actually be funding the pirate clan. Rumours suggest that the sector was offered to the clan as payment for the clan's loyalty. This clan is well known for its raids on high-value cargo traders. The Teladi, of course, deny all such accusations, claiming that there would be no profit in such a deal.</t>
        <t id="1031716">This very remote system was discovered several Jazuras ago by chance by an adventurer. The governments of the individual races could not agree on who should administer this system in the future. In order to underline their own requirement in this area of space each race built space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Split, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition period as independent administrator of this region. Each government also sent their own space workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, and even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, in which another female star warrior found her way into the X Universe. The system is now under administration by the Terracorp, who are starting to bring in their own stations and occupy empty spaces within the commerce grid.</t>
        <t id="1031717">The Goner had found this sector after years of searching for an unknown relic in a remote area of Third Redemption.

Military forces were virtually non-existent during early settlement, leaving the monastery open to attack by raiding parties from the nearby Pirate sectors. The Priests held their position in the safety of the temple caverns for several Tazuras before the Paranid managed to get a destroyer in the sector to protect it. The destroyer has now moved to the next sector to prevent such insertions into Paranid territory.</t>
        <t id="1031721">There was a time when this sector was home to a budding Paranid outpost.  Interestingly, not a shot was fired when the Paranid ceded control to pirate groups. Over the years, more notorious criminals and gang activity slowly encroached on the small outpost.  One by one, the citizens of the Paranid empire fled to safer and more comfortable destinations.</t>
        <t id="1031803">This sparse system is primarily dedicated to the production of food. The Rastar Oil refineries rely on pirate stations for their supplies of space flies and import all other raw materials from outside the system. A dense, mineral-rich asteroid field fills the whole system. Split superstition forbids mining on the largest of these asteroids, claiming them to be cursed.</t>
        <t id="1031804">On the fringes of civilised space this deep space system is no stranger to raids by pirates and other hostile ships. Founded by the Split leader Thuruk as a prison colony for Boron captured during their wars it has evolved into a thriving industrial outpost.</t>
        <t id="1031805">Discovered while exploring Getsu Fune, this sector was cleared of Xenon by a small force of ships, unfortunately soon after this mission was completed the Argon destroyer was ambushed. Its Captain's last report stated that the Xenon entered the sector from an unexplored gate, the position of which was not recorded. The Destroyer was never heard from again. The sector has rarely been entered since and is considered by the Argon to be somewhat cursed in its nature.</t>
        <t id="1031807">Horizon</t>
        <t id="1031808">Federation Core</t>
        <t id="1031809">Omicron Lyrae remains true to the courage and conviction of those who knew that this sector would not be the last will and testament to the battle fought against the Kha'ak. Here lie the souls of those not forgotten, those who understood that this would be the point at which all races would stand tall and take the battle onwards. Those remaining here are neither forsaken nor left without hope. Life goes on, while in the shadows lurk the destroyers of worlds.</t>
        <t id="1031810">The pride of the local Teladi sectors is this colony; the high tower of the Ministry of Finance stands high on the planet's surface. The Ministry was set up to oversee the Company's finances when setting up new sectors, although this wing of the Teladi Company wasn't entirely successful. When the neighbouring system, Bad Debt, was first opened to the public, the sector ran into trouble and the Ministry was held responsible. The colony skyline is dominated by the 80 story tower that casts a shadow over the gardens of trade, a large garden filled with markets and made more appealing to visiting Argon and Boron traders.</t>
        <t id="1031811">A highly defended system, for reasons that only the Teladi and few others know about. Shareholders Fortune is a new sector developed around a small field of large asteroids. The Teladi believed that this system would provide them with a source of Nividium, a rare material found in only some parts of the universe. After they found out their research ship was incorrect in this assumption the Teladi had to turn to building new factories for high-demand technologies.</t>
        <t id="1031812">When the Teladi Mining Executive came across this system, they sent several of their Explorer Ships to evaluate the system's resources. One of the ships, the Mercantile, came across abandoned space stations set into some of the mineral-rich asteroids. The technology seemed to be similar to the Argon, however they denied ever having held a presence there. The neighbouring system already belonged to the Teladi, so they quickly moved in, re-aligning the gates with the standard navigation system, near to the alien mines. After retrofitting the stations with Teladi technology, the largest Teladi mining operation in history opened for business.</t>
        <t id="1031813">This newly discovered system shows that the Xenon are still a concern; the sector houses a secondary production facility for Xenon vessels and is home to a large defence force. Some speculate that a Xenon core system is nearby.</t>
        <t id="1031814">The planet 'Tethys' has a huge population and the Boron are determined to protect the billions living there from the dangerous lawlessness of nearby 'uncivilised' systems. The local economy is very reliant on import of raw materials - most notably Teladianium which is required by the many Bio-Gas Factories.</t>
        <t id="1031815">Three Moons</t>
        <t id="1031816">City in Space</t>
        <t id="1031817">A busy and lucrative system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Blue Profit is most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Teladi factory workers. Combining Teladi reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Argon and Teladi percussion instruments, 'Teladi Blues' is appreciated by many sentient species.</t>
        <t id="1031818">The Teladi who settled this region chose to do so not entirely out of the desire for profit. Knowing all too many sectors flourished from under-handed deals and kick-backs, business here remains both noble and honest, for now at least.</t>
        <t id="1031819">Forging ahead with the combined strength of a mining and military operation, the Teladi have strengthened their foothold in the new colonies with this sector. Their plans however do not rest within these gates alone.</t>
        <t id="1031820">With most of the Paranid now in space-borne colonies, the high priest of the Paranid chose to seek a new Cardinal to set up his religious sections in the new Duchy Systems. This sector is now home to the Cardinal who chose this sector for the capital of the Second Duchy. The system boasts shipyard facilities, and equipment docks, as well as being guarded by a Destroyer ship, mainly for protection from the Pirates from past the north gate.</t>
        <t id="1031821">When the Paranid first entered this system they found an empty sector accessible by two gates, but the planet remains a mystery here. There are a few remnants of a civilization with one relic - a needle-like object made from stone that stands 3 stories high, in the middle of what may have been a city. At the foot of the monument a large gemstone was found inside a carved stone case. After prolonged surveys it was discovered that there was once a large building here, which was thought to be a temple. Scientists today are still trying to understand what the script on the needle object means.</t>
        <t id="1031907">Frontier Gate</t>
        <t id="1031908">The furthest Federation outpost from Argon Prime, this dangerous system is both a deep-space resupply point and military tracking station. Xenon activity in this system is carefully monitored by a covert Federation branch who are rumoured to have an inaccessible base hidden near the storm-battered planet 'Hades'.</t>
        <t id="1031909">This struggling Argon agricultural system is situated between the breathtaking planets 'Garleth Prime' and 'Garleth Beta'. Recent attacks on supply lines by Xenon forces have led to many fire-fights among the installations, asteroids and the busy trade routes in this system.</t>
        <t id="1031910">The eternal story, of growth and development, profit and expansion; all of these things are the very essence of Teladi commerce. This Core sector specialises in high-tech goods and energy production. There are rumours that the story does not end within this region. Many will attest to the Teladi proverb that there is profit in exploration.</t>
        <t id="1031911">Trader's Peace</t>
        <t id="1031912">Fields of Nividium</t>
        <t id="1031913">A recent discovery, and one which caused some degree of concern, 627 shows signs of being the gateway to further Xenon sectors. Long-range scout vessels have yet to mark any confirmed transit vectors.</t>
        <t id="1031914">The Argon military recently expanded into the previously unknown sector to supplement M148's growing demands.</t>
        <t id="1031915">Thor's Might</t>
        <t id="1031916">Accretion Disc</t>
        <t id="1031917">Highly destructive PAC/PPC Weapons are built here under strict Teladi Military guard. Most of the personnel in this system are tied to the military arm of the Profit Guild or the smaller Teladi Company Navy. The market for recreational and luxury goods is high among those personnel on guard detail in a relatively safe system.</t>
        <t id="1031918">This busy Teladi colony was named in honour of the warriors and civilians of all species who perished in the first great Xenon conflict. The system itself is sparse and lacks many basic comforts. The Teladi here are possibly even more avaricious and sneaky than their homeworld brothers.</t>
        <t id="1031919">{19,1}\n\nThe Y sectors were mostly initiated by the Teladi Company and Teladi private security.</t>
        <t id="1031920">This sector is occupied by one planet and the remains of its only moon. It is unknown how the moon was destroyed in this manner, but the fallout has caused the planet's atmosphere to become irradiated, leaving it deadly to all forms of life. When the Paranid moved in, they set up a standard colony with basic resources. Hopefully in time more will be built.</t>
        <t id="1031921">This is last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors. This sector is famed for its lack of hospitality. It is said to be a retreat for the Pontifex in case he needs to leave the main sectors and be out of contact for one reason or another. Deep within the Second Duchy, this sector is hard to reach, especially with the pirate sectors inhabiting a route into this area.</t>
        <t id="1032008">This strange system is named for a goner belief that Nathan R Gunne once visited this system, the reason for this belief is that when first entered, a piece of debris was found, after an investigation it was found to be from two ancient fleets. All the debris has been cleared up and a new system has been forged in the brown nitrogen dioxide nebula streams of the system. Pirate activity is also increased and has meant increased military patrols in this system. Many pilots tend to avoid the gas clouds, as pirate ships have been known to hide in the nebulae and then participate in surprise attacks. The local population are made of mixed labour level, from high tech support to miners.</t>
        <t id="1032012">One of the most heavily entrenched of the Xenon sectors, 695 is surprisingly sparse in its population. Many of the core assets and components are presumably allocated higher priority in other Xenon-controlled sectors closer to borders of conflict.</t>
        <t id="1032013">023 is known to be another core Xenon sector. Communications protocol handling and re-coding for ship A.I. is known to take place in many of the stations here. Intercept and Attack patrols are carried out by Xenon vessels of all classes, many only discovered recently.</t>
        <t id="1032014">Fully militarised, all traffic within this sector is marked for intense scrutiny. Nominal access to Shipyard and Equipment Dock facilities are authorised once security clearance has been confirmed. Any interference with military affairs will be dealt with by lethal and overwhelming force.</t>
        <t id="1032015">Tyrianis Prime</t>
        <t id="1032016">Alliance's Edge</t>
        <t id="1032017">Although this system is a hive of Agricultural and Industrial activity many respectable traders and merchants avoid it. Adventure seekers and rogues of all species frequent this system, the often Pirate Base is a real den of iniquity and squalor. This system is a major link in the Split - Teladi trade route and its safety is jealously protected by the Profit Guild.</t>
        <t id="1032018">The Teladi have only recently re-discovered this historically important system. Ianamus Zura already has its own thriving economy, mainly due to its position on a busy trade route. It provides a broad range of raw materials to many neighbouring systems and serves as the HQ of both the Profit Guild and Teladi Company in the new territories.</t>
